Notes for building the documentation.

We are in the process of converting from the old latex-based
documentation to .rst-based documentation.

The top-level Makefile supports making either one.

The new documentation uses Sphinx, which must be installed on your
host in order to build it.  For Ubuntu, this includes the packages:
  python-sphinx, (and maybe some others)
 

The old documentation uses latex, which must be installed on your
host. For Ubuntu, this includes the packages:
  texlive-latex-base, texlive-latex-recommended, texlive-fonts-extra

= building =
To build the old PDF documentation, do:

make fuego-docs.pdf

To build the new documentation (as HTML), do:

make html

The resulting files will be in docs/_build/html, with starting file index.html
